## Are men allowed to participate in WiDS?

YES. Men are not only allowed, but encouraged, to attend any WiDS events worldwide. In addition, several of our WiDS ambassadors are men. WiDS is WiDS because we feature outstanding women doing outstanding work.

## Do I have to register for the whole day? 

No. You are welcome to come in and out as your schedule allows. Check the schedule for times and speaker bios


## What is a WiDS Ambassador?
WiDS Ambassadors bring the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Conference to their cohort, colleagues, and community by hosting regional events that incorporate the live-stream or video sessions of the WiDS Stanford event, and/or feature other female speakers in the field of data science. 

## Will video sessions be available, post-event?
Yes. Each of the WiDS sessions will be videotaped, edited, and posted to YouTube. The conference livestream will be uploaded to the WiDS website immediately after the conference, unabridged. Edited video sessions will be available 2 days later. Today, you can view the playlist from WiDS Stanford 2018.

## How can I participate?
There are multiple ways to participate in the WiDS conference. You can attend WiDS Stanford, one of the regional events being planned worldwide, or join us online via livestream or Facebook Live. You can also participate in the WiDS Datathon, or listen and subscribe to the WiDS podcast.
