Girls Inc. of the Northern Sacramento Valley, founded in 2006, is an affiliate of Girls Incorporated, which serves girls across the United States and Canada. With roots dating back to 1864, Girls Incorporated is the oldest girl-focused organization in the United States.

Girls Inc. of the Northern Sacramento Valley is all about empowering local girls. We serve Shasta and Tehama county girls, ages 6 to 18, by offering a wide range of in-school, after-school and extracurricular programs. These research-based programs build girls’ self-esteem, transform their views of themselves, and help them recognize their potential as leaders, friends, innovators and independent thinkers. Girls Inc.’s mission is to inspire girls to be “strong, smart and bold.”
